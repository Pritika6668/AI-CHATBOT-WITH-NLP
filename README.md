# AI CHATBOT WITH NLP

- Intern Name: Pritika Dhal  
- Intern ID: CT06DF1491  
- Domain:Python Programming 
- Batch Duration: May 30th 2025 – July 15th 2025  
- Mentor Name: Neela Santosh

## Project Description
This project is a simple yet functional AI Chatbot developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP)techniques. 
The chatbot is capable of understanding and responding to basic user queries by interpreting natural human language input.
It simulates conversation with users in a human-like manner and can be extended to various real-world applications such as customer support, personal assistants, and educational tools.

The goal of this internship task was to design, build, and implement a basic chatbot using popular NLP libraries and frameworks,
allowing it to process user queries and return meaningful responses

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries & Frameworks:  
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) – for tokenization, stemming, and basic NLP  
  - scikit-learn – for text vectorization and classification (optional)  
  - Flask – for creating a basic web interface (optional)    
- IDE: VS Code  
- Platform: GitHub (for version control and publishing)

##  Key Features:
- Understands user input using NLP methods (tokenization, keyword matching).
- Provides responses based on a pre-defined logic or trained patterns.
- Easily expandable: You can train it with additional data or connect it with APIs.
- Optionally deployable as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.

## Application Areas:
This AI Chatbot project has real-world applicability across multiple domains:

- Customer Service: Assisting users with product or service-related queries.
- E-Learning Platforms: Helping students navigate study content and resolve doubts.
- Mental Health Support Bots: Providing basic support or directing users to helpful resources.
- Retail/E-commerce: Guiding customers to products or answering FAQs.

## Learning Outcomes:

By completing this project, I developed hands-on experience in:
- Understanding how natural language is processed computationally.
- Using Python and libraries like NLTK for language analysis.
- Structuring conversational flows and logic for chatbot behavior.
- Hosting projects using GitHub and managing version control.

## Conclusion:

The AI Chatbot with NLP internship task helped me gain practical experience in the domain of Artificial Intelligence.
It strengthened my understanding of how machines interpret human language and respond logically.
This task has laid a strong foundation for developing more advanced AI systems in the future
and I am confident in expanding this prototype to support more dynamic and intelligent conversations.
